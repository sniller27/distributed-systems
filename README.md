# distributed-systems
This repository is for different projects in distributed systems at university.

This assignment is about making a website/web application, where it's possible for a user to create an artist with a name, birthplace, birthdate.
Also if the artist is one of the user's favorite artists, then the user can check mark the artists upon creation.
When the an artist is made, the user will receive a confirmation message and the artists information will be visible in a list on the page with an ID.
The user can hereafter search for artists by using the searchfield in front of the list of artists and the searched artists will appear on the list in "real-time".
Eventually the user can check/uncheck their favorite artists in the list.
